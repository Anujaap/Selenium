Difference between implicit & explicit wait along with syntax.



 Implicit wait waits for a certain amount of time before throwing an exception
 that it cannot find the element on the page.
 We should note that implicit waits will be in place for the entire time the browser is open.
 This means that any search for elements on the page could take the time the implicit wait is set for.

 Syntax- driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

 Expilcit wait is more extendible in the means that you can set it up to wait for any condition you might like.
 Usually, you can use some of the prebuilt ExpectedConditions to wait for elements to become
 clickable, visible, invisible, etc.

 Syntax- wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(By.id("someid")));
