Difference between get() & navigate() method.

 The main difference between get() and navigate() is, both are performing the same task
 but with the use of navigate() you can move back() or forward() in your session's history.
 But you cannot do the same with get()
 Navigate() is faster than get() because navigate() does not wait for the page to load fully or completely.
